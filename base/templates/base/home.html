            <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              In elementary school, I was already interested in computers and
              everything related to them. My interest in programming began when
              I watched my friends making games while I modeled objects and
              characters in Blender, which we then added to the game. Now, I
              want to spend more time learning programming because solving
              problems gives me a lot of satisfaction and joy. I would like to
              improve my skills at work by creating better and more efficient
              code. I think programming is not just a job, but also a passion
              that helps me get better and learn new things. I hope to become an
              expert in this field and share my knowledge with others. In the
              future, I would like to work on bigger projects that make a real
              difference in people's lives, which motivates me to keep learning
              and growing.
